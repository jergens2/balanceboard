## About
In a pragmatic sense, time is a currency that you have a finite amount of.  Just like money currency, you have to budget how you spend your time.


### Time Management
Time management in this context means accounting for all time spent during your day, during your week, etc.
Using tools which help you better account for how your time is spent, you can look for ways to improve your routine and reduce procrastination and time-wasting activities, and maximize the utilization of the finite amount of time that you have.
