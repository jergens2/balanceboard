# Purpose

A data-collection and management tool to help you organize your life.
Task management, time management & scheduling, financial organization, and other various tools combined to assist you in storing, organizing, visualizing, and interacting with information in your life.

As the user uses balanceboard, over time the app will attempt to assist with correcting potential deficiencies in the daily routine and other aspects of your life, so as to push you towards a path of greater success.

This application is currently in development, and is not stable enough to reliably depend upon.
Please do not use this application in any serious capacity.

# Development

2019-07-27:
Currently I am building balanceboard in my spare time, as I currently am employed full-time in an unrelated career to provide for my ongoing familial obligations.
My objective is to be able to work on balanceboard on a full-time basis, and to create a high-quality application that is useful, fun, highly private, and highly secure, without any advertisements.  Currently the only one of those properties which is true is the absence of advertisements, and I intend on keeping it that way.

Eventually, when the app is ready to be deployed publicly, I intend on introducing a modest fee for the service, perhaps $12 per year.

If you are interested in this project and would like to support its development, you can donate BTC to the following address:

If you donate, please send me an email, at jeremysandau@protonmail.com, so that I can personally thank you for your support, and, if interested, provide you with development updates.


# Future plans and improvements

Eventually, I intend on incorporating several other feauture and applications within balanceboard, including:
-Encrypted chat
-Encrypted email service
-Encrypted Password manager
-Decentralised data storage
