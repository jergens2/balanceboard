## About
In a pragmatic sense, time is a currency that you have a finite amount of.  Just like money currency, you have to budget how you spend your time.


### Time Management
Time management in this context means accounting for all time spent during your day, during your week, etc.
Using tools which help you better account for how your time is spent, you can look for ways to improve your routine and reduce procrastination and time-wasting activities, and maximize the utilization of the finite amount of time that you have.




#Aristotle
“As it is not one swallow or a fine day that makes a spring, so it is not one day or a short time that makes a man blessed and happy.”
 — Aristotle, for real.

Time is a social institution, and not a physical reality.  There is, in other words, no such thing as "time" in the natural world -- the world of stars and waters and mountains and clouds and living organisms.  There is such a thing as rhythm.  Rhythm of tides.  Rhythm of biological processes.  But time, as such, is a social institution -- in the same way that language is, that number is, that concepts are, and all measurements -- inches, meters, lines of latitude and longitude.  All those things are social institutions or conventions -- the word "convention" , from the latin convenere, to come together, to agree about something.  To hold a convention, and thus of course, in it's deteriorated sense, when we say something is "purely conventional", that is to say you needn't take it seriously.
