Sleep = Sleep = Thing you gotta do, most often over the night time.
Non-discretionary Primary duty = Things you gotta do, but not at the time of your discretion.  
                    You don't have a choice in how this time is set.  E.G. your employer says you work from 8a-4p
Discretionary Obligatory = Things you gotta do, but at your discretion.  
Discretionary = Things you don't need to do, but can chose to do. 

Discretion of when
Discretion of what

Thing   -   When    -   What

Sleep   -   mostly bound by circadian rhyth, except shift workers.  so not very discretionary for when.  -   Necessary Physiological function - no discretion on what.

Primary duty (job, student, caregiver ) - Mostly do not have discretion on when, at least not on a day to day basis.  you may negotiate a different arrangement with your school or employer, but usually the schedule is fixed, on a day to day basis, within the confines of your usual rotation.  the what is discretionary to the same extent: not necessarily on a day to day basis, within the rotation.

Responsibilities (cleaning, cooking, eating, caregiving, shopping, fixing, maintaining, exercising) - have greater flexibility as to when, after those first 2 categories have been established.  -  have high discretion as to what

Discretionary activities ( TV, video games, reading, relaxing, playing, etc. ) - after those first 3 categories are established, the remainder can be used at any discretion.  The what is also fully discretionary.


Table view:

   Activity    -   Discretion of when  -   Discretion of what  
1  Sleep       -   No, with exceptions -   No
2  Duty        -   Mostly no           -   Mostly no (on a day-to-day basis)
3  Respons.    -   Yes, after 1&2      -   Mostly yes
4  Discret.    -   Yes, after 1&2&3    -   Yes

it's more of a straight-diagonal linear line across 2 dimensions, where y == x
In this definition, then "Responsibilities", falls under mostly discretionary.  e.g. grocery shopping -

ScheduleRotation in conjunction with DayTemplates establishes your basic, default, rotational time unit.

For example, a very generic ScheduleRotation might look like this:

7 days in length:
Sunday: DayTemplate = RestDay
Monday: DayTemplate = WorkDay
Tuesday: DayTemplate = WorkDay
Wednesday: DayTemplate = WorkDay
Thursday: DayTemplate = WorkDay
Friday: DayTemplate = WorkDay
Saturday: DayTemplate = RestDay


RestDay and WorkDay are defined Day Templates.

Using a combination of pre-defined day templates, assigned to your regular rotation days, you can build a very basic, high-level overview / blueprint of how you spend your time.  


Then, for any given day, e.g. tomorrow, 2019-04-02, when I open my app, it will firstly already know that Tuesday Apr 2 is a Work day.





Later, the user evaluates their own activities in terms of what is in accordance with their goals.
To do this, we therefore need to have the ability to do an evaluation and see such evaluations on activies, and then also we need to tie-in goal-setting and goal-reviewing.


After that is all complete, we can start to measure progress over time, e.g. April: Set goal to reduce video games  July: you have accomplished this. Goal achieved.  Woohoo!  

Goal review: was this is a worthwhile goal, why or why not?
did this goal provide for you the result that you thought it would?

Now that you achieved this goal, do you want to set another goal ?
