## time marks
    -time marks can be specified for any time.  this means at 1:00pm you can add a time mark that is marked at 4:00pm, then 2 minutes later mark another time mark 
      that makes 1:02pm, and you would have time marks that are out of chronological order.
      -do what about this?  make it so users cannot specify the time of the time mark? - maybe an override button - by default time mark time is greyed out but can be overridden if user wants to
      -then sort all time marks by chronological order?
        -now you get overlapping timemarks? do time marks need a start and an end, and the start should be the equivalent of the end of the previous one?
          so if you make a time mark for 4:00pm at 1:00pm, then presumably that time mark *spans* from a start of 1:00pm to an end of 4:00pm, so that time is already
          being accounted for... should you be able to add another timemark earlier than 4:00pm?
