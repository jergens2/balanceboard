## activities

Adding activities should be somewhat rigid, in that interface should be very picky that the entry is filled out properly.
For example:
    I was just going to make a time mark and then add activities.
    this time mark was about 45 minutes since the previous time mark
        I entered in an activity "balanceboard ~ 30 min" because I did about 30 minutes of work in this time period since the last time mark.
        but that doesn't cover the entirety of the time mark because the time mark is 45 minutes in duration, therefore i must have done something else with the remaining time

        So the front end interface should be adamant that the remaining 15 minutes be accounted for, however the interface should be so easy to use that most of the work is done by the interface

        Otherwise an option is to simply draw the 45 minute period and draw the 30 minute period in between it and indicate that the remaining time is simply unaccounted for.

        Should that even be an option?



Ability to use a time mark like a journal and add a detailed note / journal entry type thing






## new time mark form:

    -creating a new time mark, and there may or may not be time marks prior to this one
    form asks: "time mark spans from?" and options can be: "since previous time mark", "for the last X minutes", 
      activities within this time mark can be similar 
        -activity a spans from?: duration of 20 minutes
        -activity b spans from?: 30 percent of the duration of this time mark span
        -activity c spans from?: auto-calculate the remainder of that time

    -adding activities:
    instead of a button to add activity, perhaps just a text input box and when you type in the input box it automatically starts predicting the activity which you 
    were about to add.  and then as you add activities in the text box they get delineated as a distinct variable and has a color highlight for example


    maybe some kind of representation proportionally over the last 24 hours what these activities look to with respect to size in a kind of rectangular shape thing representing 24 hours
    kind of like how in Visual Studio Code, the bar on the far right kind of gives you a zoomed out visual representation of the entire document.
