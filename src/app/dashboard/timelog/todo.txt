Adding activities should be somewhat rigid, in that interface should be very picky that the entry is filled out properly.
For example:
    I was just going to make a time mark and then add activities.
    this time mark was about 45 minutes since the previous time mark
        I entered in an activity "balanceboard ~ 30 min" because I did about 30 minutes of work in this time period since the last time mark.
        but that doesn't cover the entirety of the time mark because the time mark is 45 minutes in duration, therefore i must have done something else with the remaining time

        So the front end interface should be adamant that the remaining 15 minutes be accounted for, however the interface should be so easy to use that most of the work is done by the interface

        Otherwise an option is to simply draw the 45 minute period and draw the 30 minute period in between it and indicate that the remaining time is simply unaccounted for.

        Should that even be an option?



Ability to use a time mark like a journal and add a detailed note / journal entry type thing
