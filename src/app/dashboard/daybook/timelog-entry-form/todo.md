1.  Allow functionality to remove an activity from timelogentrys.  currently does not do this.
2.  Don't allow more than 1 instance of the same activity ?  e.g. between 11:00am and 12:00pm, you can't Walk and Walk.  Just one Walk
3.  Do some time validation to check whether or not any timelogentrys already exist in the period of time that you are trying to create a time entry ?
