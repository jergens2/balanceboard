# Things that people should do every day

This is a draft of a checklist


example routine from https://www.businessinsider.com/i-structured-my-day-according-to-my-chronotype-2016-9#6-pm-exercise-7
wake up 730ish
10am to 2pm - do focused work
2:30 to 3pm - nap or meditate
3p to 6p - socialize
6p exercise
730p - eat dinner
9p to 11p = peak creativity = brainstorm and power down

should take about 7 to 10 days to implement such a routine

* Why do this?  Because it's "Empowering" *
"Do you want to be empowered? "

# Morning
-Brush Teeth
-Make Bed
-hydrate - drink a glass of water

-Eat healthy (vegetables, fiber)

-don't caffeinate immediately.  wait for about 2 hours after waking up.





## Lifestyle
-Journal
-Read
-dedicate time to daydreaming, imagination, creativity (or as james altucher suggests:  come up with 10 ideas)
-go for a walk
-socialize
-absorb great art outside your comfort zone
-listen to ideas or concepts you actively disagree with

"The more you can challenge yourself to be spontaneous and allow for some new experiences, the easier it will be to integrate flexibility into your everyday life!"

-practice gratitude / list 3 things you are grateful for
-tidy up
-plan something joyful for tomorrow
-set one priority for this evening





"Thatâ€™s why The National Sleep Foundation recommends turning off all devices an hour prior to bedtime."




## establish time-based rules

e.g. drugs that people regularly take have a half life, such as caffeine, alcohol, thc, nicotine, etc.

align the consumption of these drugs with respect to their half life, so that they are not impacting your daily routine.

for example, wikipedia says caffeine's elimination half-life is 3-7 hours in adults.  i think this might mean your body would be caffeine free in 6-14 hours, but of course everybody is different.
in this case, very roughly speaking, you would not want to consume caffeine 6 to 14 hours prior to sleeping.
i.e. if your bed time is 10:30, then do not consume caffeine prior to between 8:30am and 4:30pm.  I know for myself that I generally do not consume caffeine after around 1:00pm ish.  

Of course, this is not a hard and fast rule, just a guideline.
