<div class="timelog-small-root">
    Timelog Small

    Here's a concept that works.

    What if this small component is a Miniaturized version of the timelog-entry-form (which may need to be renamed to daybook entry form... not sure.)

    So it provides information such as:
    
    current clock
    Wakeup time
    Battery
    Bedtime
    
</div>
