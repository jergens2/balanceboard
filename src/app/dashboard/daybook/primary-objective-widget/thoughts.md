#Primary Objective:


Question:  Is an objective the same thing as a task?
Functionally I think they might be identical?


No, actually, 

I think that a task can be functionally defined as : any thing to be done, irrespective of time.  meaning, a task might be: take out the garbage.

It only becomes an objective when you add times to it, meaning:

class Objective{
    task: Task =  new Task();
    startTime:  date
    endTime: date
    isComplete...

}

In other words, perhpas things that need to get done in general, irrespective of time, are tasks.
Objectives, then, are tasks which you have decided that you want to give some attention to, and set a definitive end date.





2019-04-16:  currently, there is a singular primary objective.

I think a better system is one where, the user has a ton of things to do.  a pool of tasks.  maybe 5, maybe 10, maybe 15, maybe 100,




and if the user does not know what to do for the day, the app provides a list of candidates, based on parameters and data to try and determine the most appropriate objective to set as a candidate for primary objective.
