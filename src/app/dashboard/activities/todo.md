what's the point of concurrency?  
It allows two activities to share a single length of time, to indicate that both were occurring at the same time, 
for the purpose of when you want to do queries for something, then by recording both then either is true.
e.g. maybe you want to query all the times you took THC but also all the times you watched TV, but if you did not have the ability to mark them concurrently,
then you would only be able to mark one of them thus missing the other from your data.
