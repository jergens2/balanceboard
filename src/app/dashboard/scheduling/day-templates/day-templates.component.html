<div class="root">

  By establishing your rotation here, you are simply designating all time into one of three classifications: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Time for sleeping</li>
    <li>Time for doing non-discretionary activities, such as school or work</li>
    <li>Time for doing discretionary activities</li>
  </ul>
  Where, in this context, discretionary means "free time" to do whatever you please, and non-discretionary
  activities which, on a day-to-day basis, within the context of an established rotation, you don't have very much
  choice in how they are layed out.
