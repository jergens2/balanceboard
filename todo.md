## Features ?

-User preference button to turn night mode on or off

-SVG Animation on the log in screen, a little bit in the nature of tumblr but kind of more minimalistic maybe?


-Routine: 
 A routine is simply a collection of activities, eg:
    shower
    shave
    brush teeth
So in stead of performing 3 activities, you simply did 1 pre-defined routine

Create better lists

Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, starts each morning with his twist on the standard to-do list.

“Make a list of everything you want to accomplish that day. Be as exhaustive as possible,” he told Hoffman during an episode of Masters of Scale. “Group a few similar tasks together. Ask yourself for each group: What one action takes care of all of these? “It’s like a game of leverage.”

Repeat the grouping and refining process until you have just a few big tasks.

“If you have a list of 20 things to do, you end up realizing, ‘I don’t need to do 20 things,'” Chesky said. “If I do these three big things, the other 20 things will kind of happen as outcomes, or outputs, of it.”
